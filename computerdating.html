				<h2 class="heading">Computer Dating - Tim Millum</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>We were in the computer room. I had finished my work. So I started day-dreaming. Then I wrote the day-dream down. I don’t know why. It was a sort of poem, I suppose.<br/><br/>

It wasn’t very long. It was a bit soft, really. It was about this girl I fancy. [Redacted], she’s called. She’s tall with green eyes. She’s a good laugh.<br/><br/>

She’s good at making people laugh too. So I couldn’t let her see the poem. She might tell all her mates. I wouldn’t let anyone see it either, after I let them take pictures of it, but I did save it.<br/><br/>

I didn’t use my own name. We all know each other’s passwords so I saved it in Gary’s file. I would print it some other time - when no one else was around.<br/><br/>

The next week we were back in the computer room. [Redacted] was on the machine next to me. She finished her story quickly. She started looking through other people’s work. She knew how to get into other people’s files.<br/><br/>

“Let’s see what Gary’s got in his folder”, she said. I’d forgotten about my poem. “Story 1”, she said. “Hmmm. Story 3. What happened to Story 2?”. Then she stopped chatting. “Hey, what’s this?”, she went quiet.<br/><br/>

I looked up, It took a lot to stop [Redacted] talking. She was gaping at the screen. I took one look at it. It was my poem!<br/><br/>

“Hey, you can’t read that!” I said.<br/>
“Why not?” She was surprised.<br/>
“Well… it’s private”<br/>
“How do you know it’s private - unless you’ve read it?” She asked.<br/>
“Well, I…” I didn’t know what to say. [REDACTED] carried on talking,<br/><br/>

“Anyway, it’s good. It’s a poem.” Then she looked me in the eye and said, “I think it’s about me”<br/>
“Why do you say that? Has it got your name in it?”<br/><br/>

She looked back at the screen. “Whenever I loop up, she’s there…” she said dreamily.<br/>
“That doesn’t mean much,” I said. I tried to keep a straight face.<br/>
“The girl with the greenest green eyes,” she went on. “Well?” She said.<br/>
“Could be you,” I admitted.<br/>
“Could be me? It is me. And it’s a nice poem.”<br/><br/>

I wanted to say - “Yes and I wrote it!”. <br/><br/>

She looked around the room. “Where is Gary? I think ill ask him to the disco with me on Friday.” <br/><br/>

I looked at my computer screen. Should I tell her that I wrote it for her? No, I would wait until she got tired of Gary. In the meantime, maybe I should set up a dating club!<br/><br/>

The End.<br/><br/>

Afterword: <br/>
Al Murray - Unfortunately for the unnamed individual in this story, Gary and [Redacted] lived a happy life for 92 years, before, sadly, the unnamed individual died, and left all his poems to Gary and [Redacted]. He had written about 99842 in his lifetime, all as bad as this one. Long Live Gary.
