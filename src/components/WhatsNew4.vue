                <strong><h3 class="heading">- Post or don't</h3></strong>
                <p>It took a lot of sweating from Murray himself but the feed section has been smushed together, all our favourite posts are now together in one place rather than scattered between a posts, polls and adit logs section.</p>

                <p>An all new chat! yay! There's a whole new chat section, completely built by Gary this time. And get this, it no longer crashes whenever someone starts typing! Truly, this is a technological achievment that will be written about in the future. There's also some fancy commands you can use if you know how (?), ðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘…</p>

                <p>Someone got you down in the dumps? :( Someone insulting your mum? Someone asking you to remove your legally built balcony? Luckily for you, you can now GaryBlock someone, removing their posts, messages, adit logs and even physical presence from your world! Of course, when they apologise, you can unblock them at any time, and if you're annoyed but need them too much, you can always report them instead of blocking them completely</p>

                <strong><h3 class="heading">- Together but Apart</h3></strong>
                <p>The app has been rewritten in a new design language and paradigms, what this means for you is that you may have to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HhE1QcStHE">lie-down for a full hour</a> after first seeing it. Beyond that, it means vast improvements in battery life and app size! As well as your overally GaryJoyment.</p>

                <strong><h3 class="heading">- Superior Coding</h3></strong>
                <p>Wow, the code looked rubbish and it now looks quite good, which I think is an improvement - at the very least for me. Some of the old code used to leak memory all over the place and it turns out it's not meant (or really allowed) to do that, so that was fixed. Sometimes network calls failed too which was weird so those are all fixed, also there was some weird authentication-y things happening in the old version you know? That's fixed too, a lot of stuff was GaryFixed. Some stuff was GaryBroken too, but only because Al needs stuff to do in the next few weeks and months, not because he missed them or ignored them.</p>

                <strong><h3 class="heading">- MORE</h3></strong>
                <p>There's loads more, keep an eye out for the official changelog in the App Store when Gary Portal 4 releases (soon), and We can check if you download it or not, so do.</p>
