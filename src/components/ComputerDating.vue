            We were in the computer room. I had finished my work. So I started
            day-dreaming. Then I wrote the day-dream down. I don’t know why. It
            was a sort of poem, I suppose.<br /><br />

            It wasn’t very long. It was a bit soft, really. It was about this
            girl I fancy. [Redacted], she’s called. She’s tall with green eyes.
            She’s a good laugh.<br /><br />

            She’s good at making people laugh too. So I couldn’t let her see the
            poem. She might tell all her mates. I wouldn’t let anyone see it
            either, after I let them take pictures of it, but I did save it.<br /><br />

            I didn’t use my own name. We all know each other’s passwords so I
            saved it in Gary’s file. I would print it some other time - when no
            one else was around.<br /><br />

            The next week we were back in the computer room. [Redacted] was on
            the machine next to me. She finished her story quickly. She started
            looking through other people’s work. She knew how to get into other
            people’s files.<br /><br />

            “Let’s see what Gary’s got in his folder”, she said. I’d forgotten
            about my poem. “Story 1”, she said. “Hmmm. Story 3. What happened to
            Story 2?”. Then she stopped chatting. “Hey, what’s this?”, she went
            quiet.<br /><br />

            I looked up, It took a lot to stop [Redacted] talking. She was
            gaping at the screen. I took one look at it. It was my poem!<br /><br />

            “Hey, you can’t read that!” I said.<br />
            “Why not?” She was surprised.<br />
            “Well… it’s private”<br />
            “How do you know it’s private - unless you’ve read it?” She
            asked.<br />
            “Well, I…” I didn’t know what to say. [REDACTED] carried on
            talking,<br /><br />

            “Anyway, it’s good. It’s a poem.” Then she looked me in the eye and
            said, “I think it’s about me”<br />
            “Why do you say that? Has it got your name in it?”<br /><br />

            She looked back at the screen. “Whenever I look up, she’s there…”
            she said dreamily.<br />
            “That doesn’t mean much,” I said. I tried to keep a straight
            face.<br />
            “The girl with the greenest green eyes,” she went on. “Well?” She
            said.<br />
            “Could be you,” I admitted.<br />
            “Could be me? It is me. And it’s a nice poem.”<br /><br />

            I wanted to say - “Yes and I wrote it!”. <br /><br />

            She looked around the room. “Where is Gary? I think ill ask him to
            the disco with me on Friday.” <br /><br />

            I looked at my computer screen. Should I tell her that I wrote it
            for her? No, I would wait until she got tired of Gary. In the
            meantime, maybe I should set up a dating club!<br /><br />

            The End.<br /><br />

            Afterword: <br />
            Al Murray - Unfortunately for the unnamed individual in this story,
            Gary and [Redacted] lived a happy life for 92 years, before, sadly,
            the unnamed individual died, and left all his poems to Gary and
            [Redacted]. He had written about 99842 in his lifetime, all as bad
            as this one. Long Live Gary.
